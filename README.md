Installing MySQL | MacOS
* Download the MySQL Community Server DMG File from [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)
* You can exit the mysql program by entering ```exit```.
* Download the MySQL Workbench DMG File from [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391). (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)
* Install MySQL Workbench to Applications folder.
* Open MySQL Workbench and select the ```Local instance 3306 server```. You will need to enter the password you set. (We used ```epicodus```.) If it connects, you're all set.

 Installing MySQL | Windows 10
* Download the MySQL Web Installer from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)
* You can exit the mysql program by entering ```exit```
* Add the MySQL environment variable to the System PATH. We must include MySQL in the System Environment Path Variable. This is its own multi-step process. Instructions here are for Windows 10:
  1. Open the Control Panel and visit System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables...
  2. Then select PATH..., click Edit..., then Add.
  3. Add the exact location of your MySQL installation, and click OK. (This location is likely ```C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin```, but may differ depending on your specific installation.)
* Open MySQL Workbench and select the ```Local instance 3306``` server (it may have a different name). You will need to enter the password you set (We used ```epicodus```). If it connects, you're all set.
